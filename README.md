# balancedarray
A function that takes an integer, x and returns the number of different ways of forming a balanced array of size 2x.

An array P of size 2x that contains the integers 1, 2, . . . , x twice is balanced if, for each
integer k, the two occurrences of k in P are separated by k other integers. For instance, the array

P = [3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]

is balanced because there is 1 integer between the two 1s, two integers between the two 2s and 3 integers between the two 3s.
